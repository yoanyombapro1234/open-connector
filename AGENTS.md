# Repository Guidelines

## Architecture

- Keep one clear owner for each fact. Do not repeat provider metadata such as `displayName` in executors when it already belongs to `definition.ts`; pass or inject it from the caller that has the definition/catalog.
- Provider definitions are catalog source code. Build schemas with `src/core/json-schema.ts` helpers, usually imported as `s`, instead of copying generated catalog JSON.
- Keep provider execution lazy at the executor-module boundary. Generated registries should map each service to `import("./<service>/executors.ts")`, and `ProviderLoader` should call that importer only when an action, proxy request, or credential validator runs. Inside `executors.ts`, import provider runtime modules normally unless those modules have meaningful startup cost or side effects.
- Do not create barrel files such as `index.ts`. Import from the concrete module that owns the API.

## Code Style

- Prefer VS Code-style coherent modules: split files by responsibility or abstraction boundary, not by loose categories.
- Prefer `interface` for object-shaped contracts. Keep unions and mapped/utility compositions as `type`.
- Prefer named options/input interfaces over inline object types when a function signature spans multiple lines or crosses module boundaries.
- Avoid temporary ad hoc objects passed through many layers. Prefer explicit interfaces, classes, or top-level functions that match module boundaries.
- Put generic low-level casting/reading helpers in `src/core/cast.ts`; avoid provider-specific wrappers for generic reads.
- Avoid trivial pass-through helpers and conditional object spreads that only hide `undefined` JSON fields.
- Avoid proving action-name exhaustiveness with local type machinery. Do not add provider-local tuple builders, `as const`, `satisfies`, or `as Record<...>` casts just to derive action-name unions or handler maps. Prefer simple annotations, explicit records, and existing provider/runtime helpers.
- Write source comments and test titles in English. Chinese is allowed in test bodies when it is meaningful fixture data for Unicode, encoding, localization, or upstream behavior. Keep Chinese in runtime code only when it is part of a real contract, such as localized product copy, official names or enum values, provider defaults, or upstream error matching; do not translate or remove such values mechanically.
- Treat automated review comments as evidence, not instructions. Fix comments that identify real bugs, schema/API contract gaps, security issues, or clear local-style violations. Skip comments that make the code less idiomatic for this repo, and leave a brief reason when responding in review.
- Do not manually wrap code to 80 columns. Let `oxfmt` decide formatting.

## Runtime API

- Keep `/v1` response shaping in `src/server/runtime-api.ts`; route handlers should dispatch and validate, not assemble compatibility objects field by field.
- Public runtime fields should have a clear source and consumer. Do not expose local implementation concepts or placeholder fields just because they are easy to add.
- Match existing runtime wire shapes deliberately: catalog index endpoints, action metadata, connection aliases, envelopes, and error codes should stay stable for SDK/CLI clients.
- If an upstream-compatible field has no local source yet, prefer omitting it or returning a documented empty value from the serializer rather than scattering optional fields in routes.

## Providers

- Provider code normally lives in `src/providers/<service>/definition.ts`, `actions.ts`, `executors.ts`, and provider-local runtime helper files when needed.
- When purely migrating a provider from the OOMOL-hosted connector, do not copy or add provider-local tests because the source repository already owns that regression coverage. Tests may be removed from this repository after an OSS-originated provider change is reverse-ported and covered in private. Keep open-source-only shared-infrastructure tests beside the shared module rather than inside a provider directory.
- Prefer provider-local constants for official scopes, permissions, URLs, and API versions. Action `requiredScopes` should use provider-native scopes/capabilities, not private internal aliases.
- Avoid repeated action-name wiring. Define action handlers once and derive executor maps through shared provider runtime helpers when an existing helper fits. Do not add provider-local action-name unions, tuple builders, or casts solely to prove the handler keys to TypeScript.
- Do not import provider definitions from executor modules just to reuse metadata; inject catalog metadata from the server/loader side when needed.

## Provider Network Egress (SSRF)

- All provider egress must go through the shared SSRF-guarded fetch, never the global `fetch`. Use `context.fetcher` (injected by `defineProviderExecutors`/`defineApiKeyProviderExecutors`/etc.) or, in a hand-written proxy, the exported `providerFetch` / `createProviderFetch`. The guard validates the request URL and every redirect `Location` with `assertPublicHttpUrl`, follows redirects manually, and (by default) validates DNS-resolved addresses.
- DNS resolved-address validation is ON by default and runs once per request for hostname targets. Add `skipDnsValidation: true` (on `defineProviderExecutors`/`defineProviderProxy`/`createProviderFetch`) ONLY when the egress host is a hardcoded literal fully controlled by the code. NEVER add it when the host comes from credential/user input, when the base URL is a resolver, or when the provider fetches a user-supplied URL — there the DNS check is the SSRF defense, not redundant overhead.
- Self-hosted providers whose instance host is user/credential-configured and may live on a private network pass `allowPrivateNetwork: isPrivateNetworkAccessAllowed` into their executors/proxy AND thread the same flag into their base-URL `assertPublicHttpUrl` call (see Dokploy for the reference pattern). It is deployment-gated by `OOMOL_CONNECT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK`; reserved, loopback, link-local, and cloud-metadata targets stay blocked even when it is enabled.
- User-supplied content/download URLs (e.g. `fileUrl`, `sourceUrl`, `imageUrl`) must ALWAYS be validated public-only — call `assertPublicHttpUrl` without `allowPrivateNetwork` and download them with the public-only `providerFetch`, never a private-aware `context.fetcher`. The private-network opt-in covers only the trusted instance host.
- Prefer the shared `assertPublicHttpUrl` / `isBlockedIpAddress` over a bespoke per-provider hostname guard; bespoke guards have missed the cloud-metadata blocklist and bracketed-IPv6 forms.
- Gotcha: a provider that branches on `fetcher === fetch` (e.g. to gate rate limiting to production) must compare against `providerFetch`, since that is the fetcher the runtime now injects — not the global `fetch`.
- Non-fetch egress is held to the same policy. A provider that opens a WebSocket must use `openGuardedWebSocket` from `src/core/guarded-websocket.ts`, never `new WebSocket(...)` directly: it validates the target with the same `assertGuardedEgressUrl` hop check the guarded fetch uses (URL literal plus DNS resolved addresses), accepts the same `allowPrivateNetwork` / `skipDnsValidation` options, and maps `ws`/`wss` onto the `http`/`https` form the guard understands. It works on Node and on workerd, which both expose a client `WebSocket` constructor. Any future non-HTTP transport should reuse `assertGuardedEgressUrl` rather than growing a second, drifting host check.
- The private-network opt-in only means the guard permits the target — it does not make it reachable. Cloudflare Workers cannot route to private addresses at all, so a self-hosted provider pointed at a LAN instance works on Node/Docker/Fly deployments only, regardless of `OOMOL_CONNECT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK`.

## TypeScript And Tooling

- Use native Node.js TypeScript execution. Do not add `tsx` or `--experimental-strip-types`.
- `src/`, `scripts/`, and `examples/` each have their own `tsconfig.json`; project checks focus on `src`.
- Exported top-level functions and public types should have explicit return types and useful JSDoc when it explains business meaning.
- Use `oxfmt` and `oxlint`; do not add Prettier.

## Examples And Web

- Examples should be concrete scripts users can run directly with `node examples/...`; do not add every example to `package.json`.
- If an example depends on external credentials, print a clear skip message when environment variables are missing.
- Do not put web UI code under `src/`. The future console should live as a separate Vite package under `web/`.
- Public docs should describe normal OSS usage and may include official SaaS, hosted, or team product paths when they are part of the public product strategy. Do not mention internal compatibility projects or unreleased SDK behavior.

## Verification

- Before finishing code changes, run `npm run fix-check`. It runs lint fixes, formatting fixes, and the `src` typecheck.
- Run `npm run build` only when you need a separate no-fix typecheck, for example after generated files changed or for CI parity.
- Run `npm run generate:catalog` when provider definitions or actions change.
- Run provider examples manually when the task changes user-facing example behavior.
